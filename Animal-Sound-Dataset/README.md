# Animal-Sound-Classification-Using-A-Convolutional-Neural-Network
Proposed a system which classifies animal sound using a deep convolutional neural network. This repo contains animal sounds used in this work. This data consisting of 875 animal sounds contains 10 types of animal sounds. This animal sounds dataset consists 200 cat, 200 dog, 200 bird, 75 cow, 45 lion, 40 sheep, 35 frog, 30 chicken, 25 donkey, 25 monkey sounds.
